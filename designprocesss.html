                    <p>
                        Design is a very diverse and hard to pin down discipline. You have to consider a 
                        
                        <span class="highlight">myriad of factors that are often unique to the individual project</span>
                        
                        (pacing, aesthetics, player feedback, difficulty, progression, goals, story, etc). There is no "correct" way to tackle this. I've gained profficiency in a mechanics first approach utilizing the iterative method and playtesting to reach my design goals.

                        <p>
                            I start my process by doing <span class="highlight">resarch</span>, mostly by making mindmaps and gathering inspiring images and videos, associating the material with potential emotions, mechanics and themes. In this phase 
                            <span class="highlight">
                                the freakier a source is the the more inspiring it is. 
                            </span>
                            Inspiration can come from anything, often the most emotive sources produce the wildest ideas that often turn into the most engaging mechanics.

                        <p>
                            My intuition is usually a bad indicator of how good an idea actually is, so I make <span class=" highlight">quick prototypes</span> to <span class="highlight">test</span> those ideas out! I make heavy use of gif recordings and note taking to <span class="highlight">create documentation</span>. I also make use of source control to create and switch in between variations and try out different ideas without losing previous work.

                            <span class="highlight">Playtesting</span> and solo <span class="highlight">testing</span> is done automanitically by myself, but I seek to get feedback from as many people as possible, there's always some oversight when designing by myself. Watching people play and taking notes, asking generalized questions and <span class="highlight">getting feedback</span> always yields surprising results and reveals things I didn't think of. I do this especcially in the beginning so I can ensure my project is going in the right direction, when the most changes can still be made.

        <h2>habits and improvements</h2>
        <p>
            Some of the habits I have cultivated include keeping a journal for my personal and professinal projects. One of my biggest struggles with designing is <span class="highlight">tunnel vision</span>. I'll often hyperfocus on a single mechanic or element in lieu of the whole experience. Though with colleagues I'm constantly talking through my process and so this can be resolved fairly quickly. A majour goal I've set for myself is learning to define <span class="highlight">good enough</span> in the scope of a project. Re-evaluating myself often has been instrumental here.

                <p>
                    Documentation is an important part of keeping our process accountable and actionable. I make use of <span class="highlight">charts and diagrams</span> to visualize mechanics and their interactions. I also keep lists of mechanics and their details throughout the development process. Here is an excertp from a game design document I made for a recent project: <a href="ultraspring.html">ULTRASPRING</a>. You can read the entire document <a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=17wDlMnE_ILLm6ABPc3BjmN-CUnQSukSxtarget="_blank">here</a>.
