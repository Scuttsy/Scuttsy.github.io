                    I created a prototype for a game system inspired by fast paced platformers as part of a school project. I adhered to iterative design and followed the MDA approach to game design.

                    Initially began as a game design course project with a lot of rough edges, I reworked it into a small polished prototype. I'm proud of this project because of the increase in player engagement and the production being very time efficient.

            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>
                As a solo developer, I was responsible for everything in the game. Most importantly, the planning and time management. The prototyping stage was done in about 20 hours. After that I restarted, reimagining the the project from scratch and programmed the game / made the art and effects in another 20 hours.

        <!-- Iteration 1 -->
        <section class="section section-description">
            <h2>Iterations</h2>
            <p>
                After I had settled on the design pillars and core mechanic, I blocked out a level in Unity that focused on traversing great distances linearly.
                <br><br>
                After blocking out the level I implemented the core mechanic of jumping and boosting.

        <!-- Iteration 2 -->
        <section class="section section-description">            
            <p>
                At this point I subjected the prototype to playtesting. Feedback showed some positive interaction with the jumping mechanic, but players struggled universally with controlling the character and traversing sloped surfaces. As a result, players didn't experience the sense of growing momentum and speed that I had hoped for.
                <br>
                <br>

                I then brainstormed solutions to these issues and decided to implement the following changes:

                
                    <ul>
                        <li>Distribute the controls more evenly across the controller and allow the player to manoeuvre with both sticks</li>
                        <li>Implement a UI that more clearly indicates speed and boost and the difference between the two</li>
                        <li>Increase gravity and overall "springiness"</li>
                        <li>Added a timer to encourage speedrunning</li>
                    </ul>
          
            </p>

        <!-- Iteration 3 -->
        <section class="section section-description">
            <p>
                After implementing these changes I playtested the game again and found that the controls were much more intuitive and players were able to traverse the level with ease. I now felt happy that the core mechanic was satisfying and began adding polish.

            <h2>Looking Back</h2>
            <p>
                Looking back I think it's a decent game. More importantly I managed to turn a boring concept into a fun prototype very quickly. I believe this was likely due to restricting myself to a tight schedule and only spending a predetermined amount of time on it. The whole process was loads of fun and people seemed to earnestly enjoy the end product.
